// Mapping from ARPAbet phonetic transcription codes to respelling

// reedDikshaneree reads the CMU dictionary and creates an in-memory dictionary with the ARPAbet converted to the re-spelling.

// fanetik converts ARPAbet phonemes into ree-spellings. It also accunlunulates in missing any unknown phonemes encountered.

// reespel returns the ree-spelling of a word, using the given dictionary,

// read keeps on reading bytes from the reader as long as they match the given regular expression, or until there is an EOF. It returns the characters bytes read as a string.  It returns an error of io.EOF if the end of the file is encountered.
